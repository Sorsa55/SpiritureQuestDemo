lot of known issues
mainmenu work in progress/still under plans how to layout smartly
lvl 1 not fully ready but good enough for now
lvl 2 work in progress
lvl 0 work in progress
lvl 3 planed not in progress
lvl 4 planed not in progress
other stuff maybe in future
boss bit wack still, need to rewamp logic a bit
scoreboard: under planing
score system: ^^
idea: simple dungeon/level type game. player goes around level kills enemies and collects stuff
next level while player is bit stronger so are mobs.
graphs: made by myself with aseprite
